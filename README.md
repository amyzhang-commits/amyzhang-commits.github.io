## About

Hello! I‚Äôm Amy. I came to data analytics sideways‚Äîthrough music, architecture, and the patterns woven throughout both. What I love most is the moment when a dataset stops being abstract and its relationships become something like an instrument: playable, knowable, subtly expressive with its own motifs and themes. Invariably, every data structure tells a deeper story about the system that created it‚Äîits habits, its blind spots, its possibilities. Below are some of the projects I‚Äôve pushed to the limit over the last year‚Äîcurious, stubborn--all in all, committed. In return, each one pushed me to listen in more closely, discerning the contours of next steps from the trace of events.
