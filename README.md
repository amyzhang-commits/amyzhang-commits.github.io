## About

Hi! 👋
I’m Amy.

I spiraled into **data analytics** through music, architecture research, and a deep love for the feedback frameworks of cybernetic anthropology (think Bateson’s *Steps to an Ecology of Mind*). What I love most is the moment a dataset stops feeling abstract and starts to feel like **an instrument**—playable, knowable, subtly expressive, revealing emergent motifs and themes.

The projects below are ones I’ve pushed to the limit over the past year—curious, stubborn, **committed, from repo to runtime**. In return, each one pushed *me* to listen more closely, discerning the next steps from the trace of events.

**Data is a language.
Language enables connection.
Data analytics scaffolds curiosity.**

Thanks for stopping by. I’m looking forward to exploring, collaborating, and building what comes next—together.
