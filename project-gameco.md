# GameCo Regional Marketing Strategy üéÆ

**Project Date:** September 2024  
**Category:** Business Intelligence  

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Identify the best regions for launching new games in 2017 using historical sales data.

**Data:** VGChartz dataset ‚Äî global video game sales (1980-2016) for titles that sold over 10,000 units.

**Methods:**
- Filtered and organized data using Excel (grouping, sorting, cleaning)
- Conducted descriptive analysis to highlight trends
- Created visualizations to communicate key insights

---
## TL;DR

- GameCo‚Äôs global sales have declined since 2008, despite regional market growth in the EU and Other regions.  
- Japan displays unique genre preferences that diverge from global trends.  
- Shooter games are rising globally, while Japan sees increasing popularity in Action-Adventure-RPG titles.  
- Cross-genre strategies show promise but require deeper behavioral data to validate.  

**Recommendation:** Focus marketing efforts in the EU and Other regions, explore genre-targeted strategies in Japan, and pursue genre blending only with more robust consumer behavior data.

## Bonus: Exploratory Analysis Attempt

### Marketing Opportunity: Combining Genres

**Challenge Explored:** Customer crossover analysis with static sales data

**Ethical Consideration:** Hesitated to highlight Shooter genre growth due to concerns about promoting violent content.

**Approach:** Attempted to reallocate genre popularity using historical platform sales to suggest genre fusion strategies.

**Hypothesis:** Blending genres could drive sales through consumer crossover.

***FIG. D:*** *Simulated impact of genre crossover (e.g., Action-Adventure-RPG) on sales, based on platform-level trends.*

**Limitations Identified:**
- Flawed assumption that sales trends would continue
- Assumed genres/platforms were interchangeable
- Needed transactional/basket data to support segmentation

**Key Takeaway:** Future analysis requires transaction-level data to explore basket diversity, segment customers more rigorously, and treat genre preference as a clustering or sequence modeling problem rather than relying on averages alone.
