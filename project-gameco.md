## Key Insights

### 1. Regional Market Share Evolution (1980-2016)

EU and Other regions show consistent growth since 1980, while Japan and the US have mirrored volatility in market share.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Finding:** Despite certain regional gains, GameCo's gross sales have been declining since 2008.

### 2. Regional Genre Preferences (1980-2016)

All regions show similar trends, apart from Japan. Distinct genre preferences can inform targeted marketing strategies.

**Key Observation:** Japan demonstrates unique genre preferences that diverge from global patterns.

### 3. Emerging Genre Trends

**Shooter Games:** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Rising globally on aggregate  
**Action-Adventure-RPG:** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Rising specifically in Japan, despite global decline

## Exploratory Analysis

### Marketing Opportunity: Combining Genres

**Challenge Explored:** Customer crossover analysis with static sales data

**Ethical Consideration:** Hesitated to highlight Shooter genre growth due to concerns about promoting violent content.

**Approach:** Attempted to reallocate genre popularity using historical platform sales to suggest genre fusion strategies.

**Hypothesis:** Blending genres could drive sales through consumer crossover.

**Limitations Identified:**
- Flawed assumption that sales trends would continue
- Assumed genres/platforms were interchangeable
- Needed transactional/basket data to support segmentation

**Key Takeaway:** Future analysis requires transaction-level data to explore basket diversity, segment customers more rigorously, and treat genre preference as a clustering or sequence modeling problem rather than relying on averages alone.
