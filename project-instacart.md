# Instacart Market Basket Analysis ðŸ›’

**Project Date:** January 2025  
**Category:** Business Intelligence  

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Uncover customer behavior patterns and product purchasing trends to support segmentation and marketing efforts.

**Data:** Instacart online shopping dataset (2017), including orders, products, departments, and customer profiles.

**Methods:**
- Python for data cleaning, merging, aggregation, feature engineering, and exploratory visualization

**Deliverables:**
- [GitHub: Python_InstacartAnalysis](link-placeholder)

## TL;DR

- Shopper behavior varies sharply by time of dayâ€”non-peak hours (early morning, late night) drive higher-value carts than midday.
- Reorder behavior spikes after 40+ orders, signaling a shift from exploration to loyalty; segmenting by reorder patterns reveals distinct shopper types.
- Low-income customers under-purchase staple items, suggesting price sensitivity; snack purchases dominate instead.
- A custom index flags departments with high revenue and low loyaltyâ€”ideal for novelty-driven promotion strategies.

**Recommendation:** Time marketing to shopper segments, reward loyalty after key thresholds, address price sensitivity for staple foods, and promote high-revenue/low-reorder departments to drive discovery.

## Key Insights

### 1. Time-Based Revenue Patterns

**Key Finding:** Revenue spikes outside 1-2pm driven by distinct shopper segments:
- **Early Birds**
- **Evening Shoppers** 
- **Night Owls**

***FIG. A:***  *Overlaying average cart size and product price by hour reveals key revenue windowsâ€”when shoppers are both buying more and spending more. These peak periods help define shopper segments by time of day.*

**Strategic Insight:** These non-peak shopper segments drive growth with larger carts and higher-value items. Timing mattersâ€”targeted non-peak hours outperform midday in revenue impact.

### 2. Loyalty & Reorder Behavior

**Critical Threshold:** Reorder rates rise sharply after 40-50 orders.

**Behavioral Shift:** Customers transition from exploration phase to habitual buying patterns.

***FIG. B:***  *Scatterplot shows how reorder rates evolve as customers place more orders. Shopper typesâ€”'Creature of Habit', 'Adventurous Shopper', and 'Open to Suggestion'â€”highlight behavioral thresholds tied to loyalty.*

**Business Impact:** Loyalty builds predictable, high-reorder purchase patterns that can be leveraged for inventory planning and personalized marketing.

### 3. Income-Driven Department Trends

**Methodology:** Department purchases were normalized by the number of users in each demographic group to compare average behavior per person rather than total volumeâ€”mitigating proportional scaling bias and producing a behavior-adjusted purchasing matrix.

**Key Patterns:**
- **High/Mid-Income:** Dominant in meat & seafood purchases
- **Low-Income:** Dominant in snack buying
- **Staples (frozen, dairy, pantry):** Under-purchased by low-income groupsâ€”indicates possible price sensitivity
- **Beverages:** Consistent purchasing across all income groups

## Bonus: Exploratory Modeling

### Department Opportunity Index (Multifactor)

**Innovation:** Built a custom index ranking departments by revenue potential and customer novelty behavior.

**Objective:** Spotlight departments that are high-revenue yet suggestible to experimentation (low reorder rates, potential for "whim" or trial-driven purchases).

**Index Components:**
- **Average revenue per order** â†’ financial value
- **Reorder rate** â†’ habit/loyalty indicator  
- **Non-reorder rate** â†’ novelty/impulse potential

![Department Opportunity Index Heatmap](assets/img/insta_dept_opportunity_index.png)
***FIG. D:*** *Which departments drive revenueâ€”and which are ripe for discovery? This index blends three factors: (1) average revenue per order, (2) reorder rank, and (3) non-reorder rank. A **large positive rank gap** (more non-repeat purchases) flags novelty-driven departments ideal for promotions and product discovery. A **negative gap** highlights habit-driven categoriesâ€”strong candidates for loyalty and retention strategies.  
**In short:** this index helps prioritize departments that are either:
- High-value and ready for exploration, or  
- Consistent performers that thrive on repeat business.*

**Strategic Application:** Use insights to design growth campaigns targeting underutilized but high-value departments.

**Technical Lessons Learned:**
- Used rank inversion to weight behavioral gapsâ€”complex but powerful approach
- Ranking-based indexes are intuitive for comparison but sensitive to directionality
- Must stay organized when layering multiple metrics
- Future consideration: Explore z-score or percent-based normalization for smoother weighting, though ranks effectively identified "standouts"

## Recommendations

### 1. Align Marketing with Shopper Timing
Proactively adjust marketing campaigns to match time-based shopper profilesâ€”**Early Bird, Midday Shopper, Evening Shopper, and Night Owl**â€”to capture revenue during peak purchasing windows outside traditional midday hours.

### 2. Boost Customer Adventurousness & Loyalty
- **For Non-Reordering Customers:** Target with promotions that encourage product sampling and experimentation
- **For Regular Shoppers:** Use loyalty programs and personalized offers to increase repeat business and build on established purchasing habits

### 3. Address Price Sensitivity for Staple Goods
For high-volume staple items, implement price-sensitive strategies such as lower price points, bulk discounts, and value packs to counter reduced purchases among low-income groups and expand market accessibility.
